# OpenTimestamps Client TODO list


## "Sums" mode

Useful to have a special mode for sha256sum output that built a tree of the
hashes, and allowed for later extraction - not unlike Git tree mode.


## Digest stamping

Should be able to specify a digest to timestamp, rather than being limited to
timestamping files.


## Lite-Client Support

Probably best to add a way to get headers from calendar servers + other
sources, then check PoW. Also need to improve docs re: using a pruned node.


## Pruned Node Explanation

Explain requirements for running a pruned Bitcoin node - it's really not as big
a deal as people think!
