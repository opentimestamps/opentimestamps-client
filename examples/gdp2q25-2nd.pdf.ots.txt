OpenTimestamps is sufficiently flexible that OTS proofs can often be created
for messages timestamped via other mechanisms, including ad-hoc standards.
gdp2q25-2nd.pdf.ots is an example of this: in 2025 the US Government Commerce
Department timestamped gdp2q25-2nd.pdf with a manually created Bitcoin
transaction, fcf172401ca9d89013f13f5bbf0fc7577cb8a3588bf5cbc3b458ff36635fec00
